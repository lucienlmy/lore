/// `relative` in it:
///
/// - the Lore directory is cloned as an on-disk instance's is ([`crate::fs::os::clone::visit`]),
///   its modified-time records with it, which hold the times the mount reports;
/// - the local files under [`WRITE_DIR`] are cloned, leaving out Lore directories and nested
///   repositories, as an on-disk instance's tree does ([`crate::fs::os::clone::visit_tree`]);
/// - the deletion list is cloned. One cloned during an append can end inside a line, which the
///   mount drops as it drops one a crash cut short;
/// - nothing else is: not the staging directory of the writes under way, nor the file a rewrite of
///   the deletion list fills.
